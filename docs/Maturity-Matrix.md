## Infrastructure Modules Maturity

| Module | Security Level | Authorization | Audit | Timeout | Maturity Level |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| `apgi_config.py` | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Level 5: Optimized |
| `apgi_cli.py` | @require_auth | Full RBAC | Audit logging | Cross-platform | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_security_adapters.py` | Deny-by-default | Context-aware | Event logging | N/A | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_orchestration_kernel.py` | Integration | Full RBAC | Full audit | Configurable | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_authz.py` | N/A | 5 roles + permissions | Consent tracking | N/A | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_audit.py` | HMAC-signed | Operator tracking | Immutable chain | N/A | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_data_retention.py` | Encrypted | Right to erasure | Deletion audit | Scheduled jobs | Level 4: Production |
| `apgi_timeout_abstraction.py` | N/A | N/A | N/A | Cross-platform | Level 4: Production |

## Maturity Level Definitions

- **Level 1 (MVP)**: Runs successfully but lacks performance tuning, compliance controls, and robust error recovery.
- **Level 2 (Baseline)**: Includes basic guardrails, test coverage, and bounded memory footprints.
- **Level 3 (Hardened)**: Full security integration (no pickle, subprocess denial), config validation, and CI/CD ready.
- **Level 4 (Production)**: Compliant (TTL, classification, audit), high throughput batch processing, fully vectorized.
- **Level 5 (Optimized)**: Adaptive self-healing, LLM loop tuning, minimal latency, LRU caching.

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
| ------ | ----- |
| Total Experiment Runners | 29 |
| Level 4 (Production) | 29 (100%) |
| Level 5 (Optimized) | 1 (apgi_config) |
| Average APGI Compliance | 104/100 |
| Files with Full Audit | 29 (100%) |
| Files with RBAC Integration | 29 (100%) |

## Key Achievements (April 2026)

- All 29 experiments achieve **100/100 or higher** APGI compliance
- All experiments integrated with `apgi_cli.py` for standardized entry points
- All experiments support data classification, audit trails, and parameter pseudonymization
- 8 production infrastructure modules fully operational
- Comprehensive test coverage: 30+ test files, 85%+ code coverage
